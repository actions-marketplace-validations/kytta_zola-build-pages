# zola-build-pages

Builds a [Zola] website as an action.

This is an alternative to [shalzz/zola-deploy-action](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action).
I didn't like the Dockerfile approach as it took to long to build the Dockerfile
on each workflow run.

This action is a [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action).
As such, it doesn't require building a Dockerfile and is being run directly in
the runner.

## Usage

As for now, this action works **only** on `ubuntu-*` runners.

### Basic

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: kytta/zola-build-pages@v1
    with:
      zola-version: "0.17.1"
```

`zola-version` is an optional input, but it is highly recommended to pin it
to become reproducible builds.

### Inputs

The inputs of the action roughly resemble those of Zola.

| **Name**       | **Default value**  | **Description**                               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `zola-version` | `0.17.1`           | Zola version to use.                          |
| `root`         | `.`                | Directory where the source files reside.      |
| `config`       | `config.toml`      | Path to a config file in the root of project. |
| `base-url`     | _from Zola config_ | Force the base URL to be that value.          |
| `output-dir`   | `./public`         | Outputs the generated site in the given path. |
| `drafts`       | `false`            | Include drafts when building the site.        |
